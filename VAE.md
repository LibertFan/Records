# Variational Auto-Encoder
## 1.Conditiaonal Variational Auto-Encoder
Assuming that we need to generate something based on certain source, but what can be generated is not unique.

We can select the best one from the generated ones(?)
and take its gradient backprop.

## 2.Information Clearning

Fader neural network

## 3.Reparametric Method

Reparametric trick is not very suitable for Conditional Auto-Encoder !
