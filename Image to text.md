## 1. FCN 

## 2. YOLO 

Generate coarse region candidates from anchor points of the last FCN layer.

This is an alternative to RoI in the case that we don't have the tagged dataset.

## 3. Submodular Maximization

Maximizing a submodular function with a greedy algorithm yields a good approximation to the optimal solution

What is the properties of submodular function ? 

How to construct submodular function ?

Why does submodular cooperating with greedily algorithm is able to approach the optimal solution ?
