## 1. FCN 

## 2. YOLO 

Generate coarse region candidates from anchor points of the last FCN layer.

This is an alternative to RoI in the case that we don't have the tagged dataset.

How to ganrantee the reasonability of region reversed in the original image.

## 3. Submodular Maximization

Maximizing a submodular function with a greedy algorithm yields a good approximation to the optimal solution

What is the properties of submodular function ? 

How to construct submodular function ?

Why does submodular cooperating with greedily algorithm is able to approach the optimal solution ?  

## Q1: During traning, how to pair region sequence and the corresponding question ?
